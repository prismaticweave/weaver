# Weaver Terms of Service
**Version 1.0**  
**Last updated: 08.04.25**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Weaver, a local-first assistant application developed by Prismatic Weave Studio (pending LLC formation). By accessing, downloading, or using Weaver, you agree to the terms outlined in this Terms of Service agreement. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you must not use Weaver.

Weaver is a desktop and browser-based AI assistant designed for reasoning, file analysis, and interactive querying.

## 2. Software Conditions and Access

Weaver operates entirely on client-side resources, meaning all core computations and processing are handled on your own machine. No cloud infrastructure or server access is required to use Weaver.

**What does client-side mean?**  
The software runs directly on your device (desktop or browser), and all processing—including file parsing, AI inference, and memory management—is performed locally.

Weaver is optimized to run on consumer-grade hardware, including older laptops and systems with modest specifications.

Weaver is available in two forms:

- **Browser-based version**: Free to use under Personal or Academic use terms.
- **Desktop application**: Paid one-time download that includes full offline functionality, access to custom features, and dedicated support.

All dependencies are bundled with the installer where applicable.

## 3. Data Privacy and Local Storage

- Weaver does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) under any circumstance.
- Once saved by the user, Weaver no longer manages any local data.
- User-saved data is retained indefinitely unless manually deleted.
- Memory data is stored locally and never shared externally.
- Users can export and manage their data manually.

For more, see the [Privacy, Memory, & Data Management Policy].

## 4. Memory and Performance Data

- Memory is available in all modes except temporary chat.
- Performance data submission is entirely optional and only occurs with explicit user consent.
- Submitted data is anonymized and used solely for performance improvements.
- All submitted data is purged after 30–90 days unless retention is necessary for improvements.

## 5. Red Flag Trigger System

Weaver includes a built-in Red Flag Trigger System to detect and deter intentional misuse.

- This system is local-only and does not access personal files or data.
- If triggered, it may restrict features or introduce cooldowns.
- No server-side actions are taken, and no identifiable data is collected.
- A local recovery process is available if triggered incorrectly.

Details are available in the [Red Flag Policy/Disclosure].
