# Weaver

The AI assistant they said couldn’t exist—built from the ground up with privacy, security, and accessibility at its core.

Designed for everyone—especially those excluded or priced out of modern tech. Created by someone who believes powerful tools should be open, ethical, and available to all—not just Big Tech.

This repo hosts official documentation for Weaver, including terms, policies, and public updates.
